        <h2>Memoirs of Adamus</h2>

        <p>
Scintillating street lights shone on the midnight, snow covered roads. It was a cold December night, and I was searching for any fragment of food to eat. Hunger was scratching my stomach, striking at my throat. I needed something to quell the pain and get me through this difficult night. But these streets were difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
The icy stares from people were colder than the wind. They looked at me like some kind of dying creature. They were kind of right: my ribs stretched my chest and my cheeks outlined my cheekbones. I was more like an undead than human. But that's how they treated us orphans, like dead weight. It was survival of the fittest, smartest, and swiftest. Get left behind and you die, or even worse, get caught by the Popos. 
</p>

<p>
My feet gave into frostbite five hours ago, and my poor excuse for clothing rags were holding together by threads of patches. Anything to eat, I thought. Anything to nibble on. A piece of bread, cabbage, anything these hypocrites consume that can hold me over for the night. I started to feel lightheaded and angry at the frustration of not finding anything this night. It was the snow, or more precisely, the water. Water always had that effect on my ability, smudging my sights. I kept trudging through the snow. Then, in a dark alley between Samilia's Bakery and Bank of Jerome, stood my ticket to a glorious buffet.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I noticed about this guy were his grey eyes. They pierced through me, my soul, as if he knew my abilities and everything about me. Oddly familiar, I brushed off this feeling and continued towards him. I knew this was my chance.
</p>

<p>
"Spare a penny for an orphan?"
</p>

<p>
He obviously had more than that. $203.55 more.
</p>

<p>
"Nope." He looked past me.
</p>

<p>
The trick to pickpocketing is to distract the eyes and confuse the touch. The magic number is four touch points, any more than that and the person can't feel. So began my thieving act, scene a thousand and something.
</p>

<p>
I dramatically tripped and hit my legs onto his. One and two. My left arm diagonal on his chest and arm. Three and four. Now was the swiftest part. My right arm delicately swiped whatever bills it could get from his back pocket and reached back toward my chest. Hit the snow on the floor. 
</p>

<p>
I quickly got up and shook the snow off.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry about that. Guess I was born with two left feet." I said sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
I started to walk away, each step widening my smile. I was even feeling a little warm inside. Then outside. A little too hot. Burning. Suddenly, the cash I just stole was on fire. I threw it on the ground, bewildered. "What the hell?" I thought to myself. How did the money get on fire?
</p>

<p>
I turned and saw the guy chuckling.
</p>

<p>
"That was a good move. You almost had me if it weren't for this coin." He held up a quarter that was left on the ground after my miserable performance. He tossed it between us.
</p>

<p>
"You can have that and buy yourself some bread for this horrible night, or you can forget about playing thief and I'll show you something you've never seen or experienced before."
</p>

<p>
In that moment, a rush of calculated judgment coursed through my head. I knew this guy knew about my secret, so if I leave him he could potentially break it to the Popos, and they could take me in for suspected witchcraft. On the other hand I could make a dash for that coin and break away from this event ever happening.
</p>

<p>
"Alright, you win."
</p>

<p>
I walked towards him looking at his eyes, arms at my sides.
</p>

<p>
"I never really wanted to take your cash, but I just had to..." I swiped the coin from the snow and tried to make a dash for it. 
</p>

<p>
"Adam."
</p>

<p>
I stopped dead in my tracks. I turned to him, looking straight at this guy.
</p>

<p>
"How do you...?"
</p>

<p>
He brushed off my question with his hand.
</p>

<p>
"If you ask here, you've just have more questions."
</p>

<p>
He walked towards me.
</p>

<p>
"But if you want to pull the thread and find out, you'll have to drop the coin."
</p>

<p>
Who was this guy? How did he know my name? I forgot the piercing pains from my stomach. The cold winter air filled my lungs with a renewed spirit. It sparked within me. 
</p>

<p>
I threw the coin behind me. 
</p>


        <h2>Devil's Drink</h2>
            <p>
              Paul held the bottle of whiskey with a lethargic grip as he hiked through the forest, away from the hellhole they call home. The night air held a pure fresh smell, cleansing his mind from the fight he just had with his wife. Twigs snapped as he marched relentlessly. 
            </p>

            <p>
              He took a strong swing of the bottle, then broke it on the trunk of a tree.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's much to be learned from this land, he said to himself as he looked around. The canopy of the tall trees hid the moon away from him, but he knew past the towering trunks was a white moon looking down at him. 
            </p>

            <p>
              I'd better get back, he thought. As he turned around, he heard a fearsome cry. The sound of a beast echoed through the foliage. His eyes widened with intensity, trying to get a glimpse of where the beast is. He quickly tumbled his way between a covering of boulders, tossing some leaves onto his body in an attempt to blend in with the forest. He strains his eyes, trying to focus on the distance. If he sees the beast first, he might have a chance of survival.
            </p>

            <p>
              The footsteps of the grizzly bear boomed. His eyes were yellow, and the jaws spewed forth a terrible sight of a bubbling mixture. His eyes were hungry for any excuse of a meal. Paul shook with fear. He was face to face with a creature that he could not reason with, much less overpower. He looked around for anything to defend himself with. Leaves, twigs, dandilions, broken bark scattered the ground. He was defenseless, and the beast was coming closer to the boulders.
            </p>

            <p>
              The bear came sniffing towards Paul. As he slowed up towards the boulders, he stood on his back legs. Paul was in awe. The bear was a looming seven feet high, blocking all that was between Paul and the forest. It was his chance, Paul thought to himself. He jolted up and began running away from the bear. He ran as fast as he could, not looking for a second behind him. His legs pumped him past the trees and rocks, quickly tiring out on him. Suddenly, a powerful swipe knocked him against a tree. He fell toward the ground, dazed and confused.
            </P>

            <p>
              As Paul looked up, he saw the beast charging towards him. This is it, he thought. Death by the forces that be. The beast took a lunge, and grabbed Paul by the neck.
            </p>

            <p>
              Paul woke up. He felt his neck with his hand. "It was...just a dream?" He said. He breathed a sigh of relief, laying back on his bed. He looked to his right, his wife asleep. He turned to his left, a half empty bottle of whiskey. He took the bottle and poured it out onto the porch. Never again would he turn into the beast of his nightmares. 
            </p>

        <h2>Javalin</h2>

        <p>
          "There's nothing in space. It's all black, like opening your eyes under the ocean in the night." Sari's eyes looked out of vessel's bay window. Enkidu, the Alqouraz Empire's elite messenger ships, was floating in solitude in a nameless galaxy. It held the keys to Alqouraz's victory, a victory of a war that has lasted far too long. 
        </p>
        <p>
          "You'd best get back to your post Sari." Officer Gerhald walked into the lounge bay. "You could be searching for signals rather than stars." "What are the chances that someone, something, recieves our distress signal? We've been out here for countless months, searching and praying for any signs of life." She looked at Gerhalt, "I guess this -was- a suicide mission." "Don't talk like that. Even if our people are doomed, we still do what we can, what we have been trained to do." He opened the bay doors. "Meeting at the bridge. Come on." "Yes sir." Sari and Gerhald left the lounge bay.
        </P>
        <p>
          Under a cold blue light, Sari, Gerhald, the other officers, and the Commander of Enkidu met. They all held their own space around the bridge, facing towards the center. The Commander stood. His arms crossed, showing off his mysterious tribal tattooes in a foreboding manner. His husky, booming voice shook the room. "We are not lost." Eyes were wide with surprise. "What? How do you know?" said Officer Rein. "Watch your tounge Rein." Reminded Gerhalt. "Do not talk to the Commander like that." "Well mark me for death, but I'd like to know why we've been floating in God knows where for God knows how many weeks." The Commander layed out a wide piece of cardboard on the deck, with arcs and lines crossing all over it. "Since we've turned off the holodesk to save power consumption, I've been working with Gerhalt trying to pin point our exact location." Gerhalt stepped forward, "We're in Nebula Qao, Sector A8, Region 2. Based on samples analyzed by Professor Ken, there should be a hospitable satillite planet coming in our due course." The Commander stepped in, "We'll be landing in 8 cycles time." Rein punched the walls, "You can't be fucking serious! We're in no condition to risk the ship, let alone The Javalin." "We have no choice. We will make due in the satillite planet, surviving using the resources avaliable, until an alliance ship picks up our distress." Rein stared at the ground. He knew he didn't have the authority to decide otherwise for the ship. Ultimately it was the Commander's ship, not his. He looked up back at the officers and the commander. "Understood Commander." The Commander looked at everyone. "Good. Any other comments?" No one said anything. "Look alive men, we're going to land her." He approached the bay doors. "Rein, next time you disrespect Enkidu by giving her a punch, I'll snap your neck in half." He walked off. The officers disbanded, returning to their post. 
        </p>


        <h2>The Shepard and The Aeris</h2>

        <p>
      The dusk sky was the color of golden purple, the shepard's favorite color. He loved capturing this magnificant color, like the secret ink of a talented artist. "Such a spectacle for an empty desert." As the night swallowed the sun, he felt the sand underneath his ankles cool. His sheep grew weary for rest, anxiously looking for some remote spot to huddle together and get some shut eye. "Come now, we are almost there." He propped his wooden rod to help him get up, and started to guide the herd towards moving again. "Samarbil should be close." he assured himself. It is dangerous for one to travel the desert at night, what with the creatures, hunters, and moving sands out for anything that moves. This blistered feet were massaged by the flow of sand entering and leaving his sandles, passing through his toes. He didn't consider himself a shepard, but a seafarer who could walk the ocean itself. His flock was his only companionship. He felt both as a master and slave to them. "Samarbil should be there." he said, squinting his eyes towards a dark fleck on the edge of the dunes. "Let's go".
      </p>

      <p>
      "This isn't Samarbil..." said the Shepard to himself. He saw before him ancient ruins, with vine covered columns and lavish marble pavements. He cautiously walked into the ruins, thinking to himself where he could have made the wrong turn to this uncharted and abandoned place. "Follow the North star southward until you hit the Jennah oasis, then continue onward onto your right..." No matter how many times he retraced his mental steps, he found himself expecting Samarbil, but his eyes showed him otherwise. Tracing the vines on an ivory column, he suddenly realized and slapped himself, "My sheeps!" He ran back, but it was of no avail. His herd was nowhere to be found. He sunk to the marble ground, heartbroken that his only source of livelihood was gone. "These cursed ruins will be my grave." He said with a kick of his foot. He leaned on the column and fell toward the ground, exhausted by the cards fate has dealt to him. He built a humble fire to last him for the night. He watched the fires dance, snapping up to the air with the speed of a cat. The shepard chewed on some bark to avoid dealing with the pains of his hungry stomach.
      </p>

      <p>
       As sleep was just about to overtake him, he saw a glimpse of light from the corner of his eye. He quickly turned to see the fleeting light running deeper into the ruins. "A hallucination from my dreariness?" He chased after the light. He turned past huge slabs of broken marble and ivory, chasing after this enegmatic glow in a feverous pace. He made one last turn and pounced on the light in a effortful leap. The two fell hard onto the floor. "Get off of me you clayborn!" said the light. "What are you?" he said. "A clayborn that does not know our name? This is a rarity." The glow wore off, revealing a feminine beauty the shepard has never seen. He tightned his grip on her. "Don't mistaken me for a fool. I know the laws of the desert, but you are not from this land." She stared back, then sighed. "My name is Sena. I'm an Aeris." He let go. "An Aeris? I thought those were unseen sirens made up in desert folklore." She laughed. "Silly clayborn, we are as real as the sun and moon." She looked around at the ruins. "Only on special nights is Regnis made seen to your kind. I simply forgot that tonight was that kind of night." The shepard crossed his arms. "If you are truly an Aeris, then based on the folklore, I have the right to make a wish." She laughed again. "You must have slept during these stories. You're thinking of Rifits, our cousins." "So am I going to leave here empty handed?" He said. The Aeris looked at the shepard with a mixed look of pity and adoration. His well toned body made her wish the Aeris men were not thin by nature. She closed the gap between herself and the shepard and leaned in. "Here's something before you sleep." Sena kissed the shepard. His body shone with a brilliant color for a moment. He then fell to the ground. "The honest ones are always the best." She said as she headed down the darkness of the marble ruins. 
       </p>

       <p>
       The shepard woke up with the lick of one of his sheep. He quickly got up and saw his flock before him. "My sheep!" he exclaimed. "But where is Regnis...and where is that Aeris?" He turned around, but all he saw was an ocean of sand before him. He chuckled to himself "Best not to get mixed up with that stuff anyways." He picked up his rod and tapped his sheep. "This time, Samarbil for sure."       



      <h2>Machina</h2>

      <p>
        "What is it?" questioned Peter. Before him layed a contraption the size of a horse, with gears, levers, and springs meticuously orinated within the wooden columns. "I haven't thought of one" said Gutenberg, "but it is a magnificent machine." He reached for a lever and pulled it down. A flat piece of iron with parchment slammed down onto the table. As it lifted it dripped with fresh ink. "Read this." said Gutenberg. Peter lightly took the parchment and read.
      </p>

        <center>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Nam cursus. Morbi ut mi.</center>
      <br>
      <p>
        "Again, I humbly ask master, what is it?" said Peter. "Oh come on Peter, can't you tell? This is a printing press! It's a machine that will revolutionize the way we share information. No more gatekeeping copyists who decide which books to make." He patted the machine. "Now, anyone can share their books, stories, ideas with the world."

        <P>"But what about copyists? You're depriving them of an honest job."</p>

        <P>"Nonsense, the scientific progress of humanity cannot be contained by traditional occupations."</p>

        <P>Peter crossed his arms. "Who decides what should be copied then?"</P>

        <P>"Anyone with this machine."</p>

        <P>"Ah, but I'm sure this doesn't come cheap."</p>

        <P>"First versions are always expensive my dear boy. With engineers and experience, we can make it cheaper and more accessible for everyone."</p>

        <P>"Right, but with everyone printing what they want, the quality of our literature would go down." argued Peter.</p>

        <P>"What you may read as garbage may be someone's nostalgic memory of a time forgotten. Why should a select few be regulators of what we can all share with one another? Language is a blessing, an expansive skill that allows us all to share stories, emotions, and truth. With this machine, we will reach new levels of understanding and creative freedom." </p>

        <P>The two men looked at the machine silently. It shone with contrasting light and shadow under the lightbulb.

        Peter sighed, "In any case, I do not think the Church will appreciate the freedom in which anything may become printed."

        Gutenberg did not think of this, and scratched his beard. "You're right." He turned to him, "Get the Bible."
      </p>


      <h2>The Magus</h2>
      
      <p>
        Clover's Pass hummed to the tune of business deals and serendipitous band pacts. Internet cafes were common, but Clover's Pass had an allure that brought back its customers. The wooden furnishings and classic lighting transported the denziens back to a simpler time, before the Second Singularity. Punk augs huddled around the juxbox, reminiscing the early scenes of lightstep and neurobeats, while straight-tied corporate men slammed their 7th beer onto the mahogany table, boisterously ordering another round before the night is over. "Jen, make sure you keep the tab on them." warned Mr. Guro, the owner of the hidden establishment. A hard working Natural, Mr. Guro watches over Clover from afar, making sure to balance transparency and unseen deeds to his patrons. "He's still plugged in, isn't he?" Asked Mr. Guro. "Sure looks like it." Replied Jen. "How long is it going to fucking take?" Mr. Guro took a strong blow from his cigar. "He better not fuck up." In the corner of this underground forest, a lone figure patiently sits. He's wearing a CFV, computer facial visor, and occasionally hits the table with his fingers at certain yet precise times. "Don't worry, he always likes to end it at the last second." said Jen, with a grin.

        Rex pressed onto his temple. The visor make a solid click and snapped from his eyes to his forehead. He rested his arms on the table, and sighed. "Fucking pushers. Always trying to change shit at the last second." He reached for his cappuccino and threw whats left of it to the back of his throat. With an exaggerated movement, he pushed off and got up. "About fucking time." Mr. Guro slapped his hand towel onto the bar, splashing an unfortunate and underconfident drinker with questionable liquids. "I didn't wanna make it look easy" shrugged Rex. He flashed two E-cards to Guro and Jen. "The latest. It's called Lotus Supreme." "I wouldn't care if you called it Meatflap City" he snatched the cards from Rex. "Next time you wanna give us a heart attack like that I'll fucking turn off the signal!" Jen wrapped her arm under Guro's "Now now honey, he just wanted to end in style." Rex walked past them and waved without turning "You know where to contact me if you need another heart attack." and left Clover's Pass. Mr. Guro walked back behind his bar, blinding making two tonics with scotch without flinching.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cold blast of air brushed through Rex as he left Clover's Pass sliding door. The cold winter of New Nepal could mute the fiercest of fires. He looked up at the white sky, only to be looked down upon by towering pagoda's built atop humble storied buildings. He buttoned his jacket and joined in with the march of tourists, businessmen, and rebels sharing the same sidewalk. His temple chimed. He pressed it, dropping his visor to his eyes. "Hello?" "Rex, you've gotta come back. Guro is having a seizure." "Jen? Are you ok?" "The keys...he tried them but they must be some kind of a virus or something...please" She started to slowly break into a cry. "I'm coming. Don't worry" He ended the transmission and ran back to Clover. "What the fuck did he send us?" 
      </p>


      <h2>Minuit à Sousse</h2>

      <p>
        "I wish this night would never end." Aliya said. She closed her eyes as a cool breeze washed over her. Asad rolled his eyes, "And what would become of the day?" Aliya turned to him and slowly opened her eyes, "It would be awestuck by this moon's beauty." He looked away, intimedated by her breathtaking beauty. He took in the sea air in a deep breath. Not many people could visit the town of Sousse during the summer months. It would usually be flocked by tourists, for their wallets were heavier than Asad's citizenship. The bayside resturaunt was a cozy one, especially outside in the balcony with jasmine and the Nightingale of the Nile filling the air. Asad dipped his croissant into his tea and took a bite. "You know, as much as I dislike the French for overrunning this place, I really appreciate them for showing us the croissant." Aliya laughed. "Aliya, you know how much you mean to me." He held Aliya's hand as gently as a rose. "You are like the moon and sun to me." She blussed, but kept looking at his sincere eyes. "I know I haven't gotten much, but I wanted to give..." She covered her hands onto him. "I think my father's here."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Monsieur, I am afraid I cannot let you in here." The voice came from above Asad and Aliya's balcony, where the attendees are admitted in. "You deny a diplomat entrance into a resturaunt in his own province?" The greenhorn bowed, embarrassed by his lack of experience. The diplomat continued walking, the sound of his suade shoes stomping onto the ground. His entourage followed with the same authority, smacking their shoes onto the establishment. "We have to leave before my dad finds out!" Asad quickly stood up and looked around, seeing the faces of fellow couples looking back at him. "I have an idea." He grabbed Aliya's hand and led her toward the edge of the balcony. "Are you crazy?" "Don't worry, it's only a few feet until you hit the sand." The suade shoes started hitting the steps. "Oh God!" "Come on, you'll be ok. Your family might do worse." She took off her sandles, closed her eyes, and jumped. A soft splash of sand echoed toward the balcony. The diplomat sharply turned toward Asad. "ASAD!" "Oh shit!" Asad quickly jumped down, grabbing Aliya's hand as soon as he landed. "You fools, go after them!" the diplomat commanded, but it was too late. Asad and Aliya were already making lefts and rights in the midnight souk. "Asad, slow down!" Aliya cried, but Asad couldn't stop. The thrill of traversing the souk at such a pace was like a kid running around in a playground. Down alleyways of spice shops and coral jewelry booths, they suddenly came out from one of the southern exits, toward the sea yet again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Aliya fell onto the sand. She was silent for a moment. Then she started to giggle, followed by a laugh. "I haven't felt like that in such a long time!" Asad smiled and fell down onto the sand, laying his head on her. "That's what I call a morning rush." He got up and turned to her. She met his eyes once again. He reached for his pocket and took out an emerald ring. "Asad..." "It's been passed down in my family for many generations. It's probably our most valued treasure. Yet it cannot compare to you." She started to tear, but Asad hugged her before any of it could come out. He playfully pulled her down onto the sand as they looked at the nightsky. "Beautiful" Aliya said. Asad stayed silent, counting the blessings this moment contained. There was a sweet absence of sound between them, almost like the moment before a child goes to sleep. He then turned to her. "Doesn't the moon look like a croissant?" She laughed.    
      </p>

      <h2>The Missing Note</h2>

        "Shit. It sounds like utter shit". The words were like dull daggers to Jane's heart, but she knew Ms. Carol's criticism was not personal. "When you hit the notes, do not strike them with precision, but with emotion." Ms. Carol lifted her ciggarette with elegence, took a slow puff and blew it up toward her humble ceiling. She lightly scratched her forehead with her thumb. "In order to convey the piece of music, you must first internalize it within yourself. Then you reflect your thoughts through the notes you play." Jane nodded. She rested her hands in standard position. With a slow breath, she started the piece again.

        "Mmm, yes. That's it." Jane's fingers danced along the keys. She closed her eyes, hitting the notes effortlessly. "Don't get carried away." warned Ms. Carol, but Jane was already in a different world. She started to improvise, adding her own personality to the piece. It was a bittersweet and somber take on the classical piece, usually meant for happy occasions. Suddenly, she hit an off note. "Stop stop stop." Ms. Carol got up from her seat. "If you played with anymore heart you'd burst. Take a five minute break." Ms. Carol patted her dress, and walked off. Jane closed the keys to the piano. A tear rippled down her cheek and lightly tore onto the piano cover. "That was John's favorite part." She closed her eyes again.

      <h2>Guardian Part I</h2>
      <p>The sound of hustling sandles echoed through the dusk night sky, in an effort to protect what may be lost. "Get them inside quickly! It may come at any moment!" Mothers grabbed their kids, kids that haven't the slightest clue what is going on in this town. "Board up the houses fast, make sure not even a mustard seed can fit through the cracks!" Burly men with beards started shutting the wooden windows and defending them with whatever leftovers the city abandonded. From a distance, a group of horseback riders could be seen galloping toward the center of the town, kicking up a sandstorm in their wake. They all reigned to a halt by the command of their leader, David the Protector. Loyal to his word, they listended tentively. "Has the call for Magrib been proclaimed?" A man answered, "No it has not David. And the Sheik is nowhere to be found." "A thousand curses." They looked behind their back, weary of what may come in the darkness of the night. </p>
      <p>
      "Look, the walls!" The pack turns toward the humble defense of their town. Mud walls two date palm trees high have protected this hamlet for generations, and tonight it bleed. "They're dripping with blood..." David knew the moral of his men is draining quickly. "Tighten up, look alive, and cover each other's backs! I want to see this beast before I kill him!" The men closed up in a circle. Suddenly a smoke envelopes the pack. "How can you kill that which you cannot see?" A force ripples through the group, like a strong wave from the sea. The horses rear, throwing the men and David onto the ground, and run away. "Damned horses, they lose courage in times of need."

      <p>
      A small black figure is seen far away toward the gates of the town."What is that?" The figure can be seen closing in quickly. "Here it comes! Ready your swords!" The body of a decapitated man halts with sudden force in front of the group. It's the body of the town's holy man. "Oh God...", one of the men hurl onto the ground. "Who did this..." David sheaths his sword and walks toward the floating corpse. A booming deep voice reverberates from the body, "David, your unseen transgressions are worse than the scene before you. Leave this town by tomorrow night or face a fate far worse than your conspirator." The corpse floats for a moment, then drops hard onto the ground. The group is left silent, with passive winds blowing onto the dunes. David looks toward the sky, "O God, help me."
