			Tearing Apart Complexity<h6>October 7th, 2013</h6>
			
			<p>Computer programs are pretty complex beasts: they can exist in many different states, and one wrong piece of code can render your one's and zero's useless. It amazes me how huge programs, like the Windows Operating System or Halo, were made in a matter of years and came out to be successful products. How do you address the fact that computer programs are complex to write, fix, and maintain?

			<p>For Donut Destruction today, I wanted to work on the main player's bullet. I decided to use pre-existing code from a previous project of mine and use it for this project. It made writing the bullet logic of the game very easy. However, for this game I wanted to add another dimension to the bullet: a trajectory. Just as how a cannon is shot in the air, I wanted the game to replicate that sort of displacement for the bullet so it makes for interesting game mechanics. 
			
			<p>Long story short, after unsuccessfully using pre-existing code, I tried working from the ground up. 
			
			<p>There's the X-Direction of the bullet, then the velocity of the bullet depending on the angle of the cannon, followed by the Y-Direction of the bullet, then the velocity of the bullet in the Y-Direction, followed by the effects of gravity on the bullet.
			
			<p>To be able to break apart the whole problem, which in this case was replicating the trajectory of a bullet, into its smallest components is a very effective way to solve big problems. In addition, it guarantees that your code will run by the end since you've been running and debugging small parts of the program.
			
			<p>Hopefully this will provide some insight for projects that may seem insurmountable unless you break them up into their simpler components.

			Beginning the Game <h6>October 5th, 2013</h6>
			
			<p>When you're first starting your game, there's a bunch of questions you have to answer. What engine are you using? What's your game about? How are you going to start it? What version control are you using? It's a good idea to outline the basics of your game clearly and very simply. The closer the game is to your experience level, the more of a chance you'll be within completing the game on time.
			
			After learning that Unity 2D isn't even out yet (oops!), I went back to a familiar game engine library that I used in the past: App Game Kit. Pretty simple stuff I think. You can get the free <a href="http://www.appgamekit.com/free-trial.php">Trial version of AGK</a>, and follow along using the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Games-Graphics-Edition/dp/0133128075">Games and Graphics in C++</a>. 
			
			What's my game about? Thanks to October's Ludum Dare theme revolving around candy, I'm going to make a homage to the classic original iPod game "Helicopter", at least that's what I think it's called. It's a simple game where you have a turret and helicopters are flying around, and you simply shoot them. I remember listening to Eiffel65 and playing that game, so let's bring it back!
			
			If you're developing a game for the first time, or any project for that matter, you can get dizzy with what you're supposed to do. It really depends on what your work style is like. For me, making an outline of my tasks helps me to drop in and out of the project easily. It's also important in game development to try to get a working prototype *as quickly as possible*. This means do not worry about how cool your sprites look or how epic your music is. As long as your game has the logic working fine and the game does not crash, fixing the art and sounds of the game can be done later.
			
			Since I'm using a free version of AGK, I'm posting the code onto GitHub. Other options are subversion and Mercurial, but finding that a lot of programmers are using git for their projects its a pretty transferable skill to have.
			
			So, that's the update for now! Stay tuned for more updates later on! =)

			Let's Make A Game! <h6>October 1st, 2013</h6>
			
			<p>Today I was surfing the site meetup.com and found a cool meetup on Monday called "Deep Dive: Master 2D tools with Unity. I thought this would be the perfect chance for me to learn Unity 2D and start developing a game. I stumbled upon Jesse Freeman's blog where he talked about his gaming projects (which look totally awesome) and then found a cool website called onegameamonth.com. The point of the website is to ship out a complete game within a month. Motivation gained!
			
			<p>So, I've decided for my next project I'll be sharing with you the process that I go through as I try to ship out a game by October 31st. I think this will be an AWESOME side project and will really be a worthwhile journey. I'll be sharing the code onto GitHub and posting here as I make progress. You'll be able to play the game via desktop or web by the time I'm done. 
			
			<p>So, make sure you bookmark this page to stay tuned on my game! Thanks for reading!
