			Let's Make A Game! <h6>October 1st, 2013</h6>
			
			<p>Today I was surfing the site meetup.com and found a cool meetup on Monday called "Deep Dive: Master 2D tools with Unity. I thought this would be the perfect chance for me to learn Unity 2D and start developing a game. I stumbled upon Jesse Freeman's blog where he talked about his gaming projects (which look totally awesome) and then found a cool website called onegameamonth.com. The point of the website is to ship out a complete game within a month. Motivation gained!
			
			<p>So, I've decided for my next project I'll be sharing with you the process that I go through as I try to ship out a game by October 31st. I think this will be an AWESOME side project and will really be a worthwhile journey. I'll be sharing the code onto GitHub and posting here as I make progress. You'll be able to play the game via desktop or web by the time I'm done. 
			
			<p>So, make sure you bookmark this page to stay tuned on my game! Thanks for reading!
